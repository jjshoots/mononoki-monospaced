# How Do?

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjshoots/mononoki-monospaced/main/install.sh | bash -s
```

## To update fonts

Find mononoki from the latest releases [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases).
Download into this folder and move files around.

Sometimes filenames change, so this is not automated.
